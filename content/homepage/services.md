## DevOps Engineering Services

Need help to improve your CI/CD pipelines? Perhaps you are looking to lower the time it takes for your code to make it into production. We have extensive experience in setting up CI/CD solutions from scratch and can advise you on what tools might be the best fit for your needs. If you've already got tools in place, we can take a look at these and help identify improvements to increase your productivity.

## Cloud Migration

Years of experience with traditional on-premise VMWare environments and private clouds (VCloud) allows for us to be in a great position to help your transition into the Cloud be a smooth and seamless journey.

## DevOps Training

Transitioning into a DevOps environment can be daunting if you are used to a traditional IT infrastructure workflow. We have had great success delivering training on not only DevOps tools but also the processes required to break down silos and increase efficiency. We can deliver online courses, or face-to-face demonstrations depending on your needs.
